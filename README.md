</p>

I'm a Data Scientist and AI/ML/DL researcher with a Ph.D. in AI/Applied Maths/Computer Science from Institut ClÃ©ment Ader and the prestigious french engineering school ISAE-SUPAERO, Toulouse, France. My Ph.D. journey was all about delving into the world of AI and deep learning as a means of predicting how long aircraft components can remain in service.

I'm passionate about turning data and AI into real innovation and added value. I'm always on the lookout for new ways to apply my knowledge to real-world puzzles.![image](https://github.com/ansak95/ansak95/assets/70719897/944a9015-2851-494c-b7a3-24d17b967df5)
